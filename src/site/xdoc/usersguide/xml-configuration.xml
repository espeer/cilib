      <p>
        The CIlib library comes bundled with a simulator application that may be
    used to execute algorithms, based on an XML specification document which is passed
    in as a parameter to th simulator.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification defines the required instances and values which will
    be used by the algorithm during it's execution. It should be noted that all
    properties have reasonable defaults already assigned to them. If you wish to
    override these values, they can be specified within the XML specification (this
    is true when using CIlib as a library directly within Java code as well).
      </p>
      <p>
        CIlib has been designed following the JavaBeans specification (where it made
        sense to do so). As a result, all the configurable properties have getter anf
        setter methods exposed. This allows us to do some rather nice things using
        the default Java Introspection.
