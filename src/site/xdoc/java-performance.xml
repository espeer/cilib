            Many people often ask why was CIlib written in Java? Isn't Java too slow for scientific software?
        </p>
        <p>
            The following few links that might change your mind.

            <li><link href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-1998/jw-02-jperf_p.html">Performance tests show Java as fast as C++</link></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            Other reasons, apart from performance, for selecting Java as the language of implementation was due to
            the shear volume of available libraries and support for the language. Language features such as Reflection
            have proven to be invaluable.
